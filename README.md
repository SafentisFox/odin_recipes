# Odin Recipes
First actual work project from Odin. 

Basic goal is to familiarize one's self with the basic geometry of a website and git. 

I kinda already know the website part, so this will be mostly as exercise to "wake up my muscles" so to speak and to get into proper habits with git.

Haven't really properly used git before, just barely here and there.
